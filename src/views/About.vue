      <p>Hello! My name is Lisa.</p>
      <p>I am russian currently living in Mexico web-developer and this silly little website is a project to share my love for Formula 1. Because to love is to share ðŸ§¡. I started it after the end of the 2021 racing season to survive the winter break.</p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy what you can find here and I promise I will improve it. If you have any feedback you can contact me by <a href="mailto:lisakatorgina@gmail.com">lisakatorgina@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p>I also have instagram account about Formula 1 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisalovesformula1/" target="_blank">@lisalovesformula1</a></p>
